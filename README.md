It is annoying how hard it is to take photos out of Google Photos. 
They seemd did everyting to make it as hard as possible. 
This script does a little of functionaly. Works on linux (and I think in Mac).

How to use:

./manage_takeout_zips.sh /media/sergii/60034cb1-fe02-445b-aaf9-356d9bc58d93/takeout
Status:
-------
27 out of 127 unpacked
100 not unpacked

Next step:
----------
  1) Validate unpacked folders contain data
  2) Unpack missing zips
  3) Exit
