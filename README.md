It is annoying how hard it is to take photos out of Google Photos. 

They seem to have done everything possible to make it as difficult as possible. 

This script provides a bit of that functionality. It works on Linux (and I think on macOS).


How to use:

We assume you did dowload all the zips to single folder.

```
`./manage_takeout_zips.sh /media/sergii/60034cb1-fe02-445b-aaf9-356d9bc58d93/takeout
Status:`
-------
27 out of 127 unpacked
100 not unpacked

Next step:
----------
  1) Validate unpacked folders contain data
  2) Unpack missing zips
  3) Exit
```
